Based on InheritedResources

# controller#resource

Always returns the current resource instance which depends on the controller
and the current action:

  posts#index   => Post.new (?)
  posts#show    => post
  posts#new     => Post.new (?)
  posts#create  => Post.new (?)
  posts#edit    => post
  posts#update  => post
  posts#destroy => post
  
# controller#resources

Returns an array containing the current resource and all of its inherited 
resources as defined by the controller through InheritedResources.

E.g. on admin/sites/1/blogs/1/posts/1 the resources array equals [:admin, site, blog, post]

# resource url helpers

Defined for each get-able action, basically delegates to polymorphic_path with
the current resources array:

  index_url, alias: collection_url
  new_url
  edit_url
  show_url, aliased resource_url
  
# resource link helpers

  link_to_index, alias: link_to_collection
  link_to_new
  link_to_edit
  link_to_show
